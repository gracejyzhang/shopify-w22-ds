    "**Part A:** What is going wrong with our calculation is that there are outliers - user 607 made 17 orders of 2000 items, while all other orders have a maximum of 8 items. In addition, there appears to be one shop selling very expensive sneakers - shop 78 sells sneakers for \\\\$25725.00 while other stores sell sneakers for a max of \\\\$352.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part B:** There are multiple better ways to evaluate this data. If we are still interested in average order value (rather than average item value), we have a few options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Take a more robust measure of location like the median or mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Remove the outliers completely and only take the average of orders with < 2000 items and < \\\\$25725.00 sneakers. This may be difficult to scale as more data comes in and the threshold becomes blurrier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, another potential metric could be the average item value depending on what exactly we are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part C:** Using the two metrics as described above, we get the following values:\n",

    "1) Median and mode = \\\\$284.00\n",

    "2) Mean of order_amount without outliers: \\\\$302.58"
